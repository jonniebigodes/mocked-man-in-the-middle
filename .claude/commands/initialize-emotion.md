Configure the project to use the Emotion CSS-in-JS library with the following specifications:

- Install the necessary Emotion packages: `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled` if they are not already installed
- IF necessary, adjust the project configuration in files like `tsconfig.json` or `vite.config.ts` to ensure compatibility with Emotion
- Ensure that the project is ready to create components styled with Emotion
- If Emotion is already set up in the project, respond with "Emotion is already initialized in the project"
